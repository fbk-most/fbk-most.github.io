  <div class="most-section__content">
    <div class="most-section__block">
      <p>
      As societies face rapid transformations and increasing interdependence
      between technical and social systems, we envision a future in which
      digital technologies become essential for society to make sense of
      complex environmental, social, and technological
      challenges and transformation processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This requires not only more effective and efficient analysis and decision-making tools, 
      but also new approaches to democratize the access to these tools. 
      To this end, we champion a vision in which data-driven systems are
      open, interpretable, co-designed with the
      relevant institutions, organizations, and communities.

<!-- ===== APPROACH SECTION ===== -->
<section id="approach" class="most-section">
  <h2 class="most-section__title">Approach</h2>
  <div class="most-section__content">
    <div class="most-section__block">
      We <strong>research</strong> models, analysis and simulation of complex socio-technical systems 
      and blend them with methods and tools to support collaborative design, participatory planning, 
      and accountable public decision-making.
    </div>

    <div class="most-section__block">
      We <strong>develop</strong> digital tools aligned with our research agenda to help institutions, 
      large organizations, and communities understand complex transformation processes, explore 
      what-if scenarios, and make data-informed decisions in high-stakes, real-world contexts.
    </div>

    <div class="most-section__block">
      Our <strong>applications</strong> are in key domains such as cities (mobility, urban planning, 
      tourism, studentification, etc.), rural areas (tourism, climate neutrality, etc.), 
      and large organizations (in particular, Public Administration).
