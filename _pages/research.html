      <h3> AIxPA: Artificial Intelligence for Public Administration</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Description.</b> The AIxPA project – funded within the Flagship Project PNC-A.1.3 – Digitalization of the Public Administration of the
          Autonomous Province of Trento, CUP: C49G22001020001 – aims to implement an Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution
          specifically designed for the needs of a public administration (PA). The objective is to foster a structural adoption of
          AI by the public administration, developing its transformative value and overcoming the current fragmented use of AI
          itself. The project will provide a scalable model to generate a significant impact and growth for the territory. This
          requires working in an integrated manner on all aspects of AI adoption: the technological and methodological tools, the
          ‘know-how’ inside and outside the public administration, the operational capacity, the governance, ethical, legal and
          organisational aspects. To this end, the project will create an innovation ecosystem capable of involving all
          stakeholders in the area, where IT companies will play a leading role.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Role of MoST.</b> We have the responsibility of the overall technical and scientific management of the project.
        We are also in charge of the development of the Digital Twin project solution to support AI-based decision making, and 
        of the use-case on the effects of overtourism and possible mitigating actions.
