      <h3> AIxPA: Artificial Intelligence for Public Administration</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Description.</b> The AIxPA project aims to create a tailor-made Artificial Intelligence solution for public
        administrations, promoting its structural adoption and overcoming the fragmented use of AI. The solution
        developed allows for the enhancement of available data, the extraction of knowledge to support decision-making
        processes, the improvement of service efficiency and the optimisation of internal processes, accelerating
        digital transformation. Everything is done in full compliance with ethical values and current legislation,
        ensuring the responsible use of data and citizens’ rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Role of MoST.</b> We have the responsibility of the overall technical and scientific management of the
        project. We are also in charge of the development of the Digital Twin project solution to support AI-based
        decision-making, and of the use-case on the effects of overtourism and possible mitigating actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Funding.</b> Funded within the Flagship Project PNC-A.1.3 – Digitalization of the Public Administration of
        the
        Autonomous Province of Trento, CUP: C49G22001020001.

      <h3>BDT: Bologna Digital Twin</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Description.</b> Bologna’s Digital Twin is a project promoted by the Municipality of Bologna to enhance the
        public value
        of data and support innovative decision-making processes.
        Bologna’s Digital Twin is a dynamic digital model of the urban environment and its functioning, powered by data
        and information
        shared by stakeholders and citizens and collected in real-time. Bologna’s DT will provide a new civic
        infrastructure to
        improve quality of life and address major challenges of our time, such as climate change and new economic and
        social
        trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Role of MoST.</b> We are in change of technical coordination and project management.
        We also have the responsibility of the development of the "Civic" component of the Digital Twin,
        supporting the analysis and simulation of social dynamics in the city and of the impact of societal
        aspects and human behaviour on the urban transformation processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Funding.</b> National programme PN METRO PLUS 2021-2027.

      <h3>HARMONIE: Health Assessment Refinement for Mitigating Noise and Air Quality Effects</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Description.</b> Urban air and noise pollution are silent threats affecting millions of Europeans every day.
        To help cities address this challenge, the HARMONIE project aims to develop advanced tools that support informed
        policymaking. It improves monitoring and modelling of air and noise pollution and provides tools to evaluate the
        health impacts of urban policies and actions in both the short and long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Role of MoST.</b> We develop a citizen-centric digital twin designed to understand and change citizens'
        behaviors that impact on urban pollution — from those that generate higher or lower emissions to those that
        determine different levels of exposure to pollutants.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Funding.</b> Funded by the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme under grant agreement No. 101238943.

      <h3>ICSC: National Research Centre for High Performance Computing, Big Data and Quantum Computing</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Description.</b> The Center conducts R&D, nationally and internationally, for innovation in high-performance
        computing, simulations, and big data analytics. This aim is pursued through a state-of-the-art infrastructure
        for high-performance computing and big data management, and research and development in key thematic areas of
        strategic interest to the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Role of MoST.</b> We co-lead the "spoke" (sub-project) focusing on Digital Society and Smart Cities, where we
        dedvelop models and algorithms for urban / civic digital twins.
      </p>

      <h3>FAIR - Future Artificial Intelligence Research</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Description.</b> The FAIR project is a major national initiative on Artificial Intelligence, funded by PNRR.
        The project aims to lay the scientific foundations for the AI of the future and to translate them into
        services, bringing together all the key players in Italian AI research.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Role of MoST.</b> We are investigating digital twins as key tools to integrate and orchestrate different AI
