### Approach

We **research** models, analysis and simulation of complex socio-technical systems and 
blend them with methods and tools to support collaborative design, participatory planning, and
accountable public decision-making. 

We **develop** digital tools aligned with our research agenda 
to help institutions, large organizations, and
communities understand complex transformation processes, explore what-if scenarios, 
and make data-informed decisions in high-stakes, real-world contexts.

Our **applications**  are in key domains such as cities (mobility, urban planning, 
tourism, studentification, etc.), rural areas (tourism, climate neutrality, etc.), 
and large organizations (in particular, Public Administration).
