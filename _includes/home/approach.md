## Approach

Our **research** explores the dynamics of socio-technical systems by adopting 
and extending tools and methods from complex adaptive systems, agent-based systems, 
computational social science, motivational digital systems, user engagement.

Our **development** focuses on producing digital tools that are aligned with our 
research agenda and that are ready to be adopted in living lab environments.

Our **applications** are in key domains such as cities (mobility, urban planning, 
tourism, studentification, etc.),  rural areas (tourism, climate neutrality, etc.), 
and large organizations (in particular, Public Administration).
