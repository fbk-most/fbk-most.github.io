As societies face rapid transformations and increasing interdependence
between technical and social systems, we envision a future in which
digital technologies serve as transparent, participatory tools
that empower citizens and strengthen collective agency. We aim to
contribute to how society makes sense of complex challenges—such
as implementing inclusive urban policies, addressing
congestion in shared spaces and infrastructure, or
responding to emergencies—through collaborative
and democratic means. To this end, we champion
a civic vision in which data-driven systems are
open, interpretable, and co-designed with the
relevant institutions, organizations, and communities.
