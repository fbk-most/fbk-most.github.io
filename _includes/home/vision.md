### Vision

As societies face rapid transformations and increasing interdependence
between technical and social systems, we envision a future in which
digital technologies become essential for society to make sense of
complex environmental, social, and technological
challenges and transformation processes.
This requires not only more effective and efficient analysis and decision-making tools, 
but also new approaches to democratize the access to these tools. 
To this end, we champion a vision in which data-driven systems are
open, interpretable, co-designed with the
relevant institutions, organizations, and communities.
