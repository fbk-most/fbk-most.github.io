The Modeling and Simulation of Techno-Social Systems (MoST) unit at [Fondazione
Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/) develops AI- and data-driven methods to
model and simulate complex socio-technical systems in support of public
decision-making and civic participation.

Our research explores human behavior in physical space, with a focus
on complex systems such as urban mobility, rural infrastructure,
and environmental resilience. We study how these systems respond to
stress—such as overcrowding, overtourism, natural disasters, population
shifts—drawing on multidisciplinary approaches that integrate data
science, computer engineering, urban planning, and design. Collaborating
with public institutions and civil society, we co-design methods and tools
to support understanding, scenario exploration, planning, and decision-making.

The group is part of the [Digital Society Center](https://digis.fbk.eu/).
