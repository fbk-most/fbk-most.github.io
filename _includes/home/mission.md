We study, model, and simulate complex socio-technical systems to
support collaborative design, participatory planning, and
accountable public decision-making. Our work blends computational
methods, co-design, and domain expertiseâ€”for example, in urban
planning and transportation. We develop production-ready
digital tools to help institutions, large organizations, and
communities understand constraints and conflict,
explore what-if scenarios, and make data-informed decisions in
high-stakes, real-world contexts.
