## Projects

### AIxPA: Artificial Intelligence for Public Administration

**Description**. The AIxPA project – funded within the Flagship Project PNC-A.1.3 – Digitalization of the Public Administration of the
Autonomous Province of Trento, CUP: C49G22001020001 – aims to implement an Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution
specifically designed for the needs of a public administration (PA). The objective is to foster a structural adoption of
AI by the public administration, developing its transformative value and overcoming the current fragmented use of AI
itself. The project will provide a scalable model to generate a significant impact and growth for the territory. This
requires working in an integrated manner on all aspects of AI adoption: the technological and methodological tools, the
‘know-how’ inside and outside the public administration, the operational capacity, the governance, ethical, legal and
organisational aspects. To this end, the project will create an innovation ecosystem capable of involving all
stakeholders in the area, where IT companies will play a leading role.

**Role of MoST**. We have the responsibility of the overall technical and scientific management of the project.
We are also in charge of the development of the Digital Twin project solution to support AI-based decision making, and 
of the use-case on the effects of overtourism and possible mitigating actions.

### BDT: Bologna Digital Twin

**Description**. Bologna’s Digital Twin is a project promoted by the Municipality of Bologna to enhance the public value
of data and support innovative decision-making processes.
Bologna’s Digital Twin is a dynamic digital model of the urban environment and its functioning, powered by data and information

improve quality of life and address major challenges of our time, such as climate change and new economic and social
trends.

**Role of MoST**. We are in change of technical coordination and project management.
We also have the responsibility of the development of the "Civic" component of the Digital Twin,
supporting the analysis and simulation of social dynamics in the city and of the impact of societal
