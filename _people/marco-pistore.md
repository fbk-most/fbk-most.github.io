Marco received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Pisa in 1998 with a thesis on a theoretical model to
describe distributed systems with history-dependent behavior.

He subsequently gained over 25 years of research experience in various fields, including artificial intelligence,
software engineering, software architectures and distributed systems, ranging from basic to “mission oriented” and
industrial research.

During 2021-2024, he served as director of the [Digital Society](https://digis.fbk.eu/) research center
of Fondazione Bruno Kessler, a multidisciplinary team of more than 100 PhD students, researchers, technologists and
managers with the mission to perform advanced research and develop innovative digital
technology to address key challenges of the future digital society.

Marco has strong leadership and management experience, gained primarily in science and academia, but with significant
experience in business. An eclectic approach to research and leadership that has led him to learn about and adopt a
variety of scientific and management methods and approaches and helped develop his critical thinking skills.
